  <h1>Photography is a passion of mine and here are some photos I've taken!</h1>

  <img src="releasing_bluegill.jpg" alt="releasing a bluegill" width="700">

  <h2>I photographed this bluegill as I released it. </h2>
    <p>It was challenging to get a good photograph as the fish splashed so much as he swam away.</p>
    <p>Not to mention that I had to photograph one handed as I released it with the other!</p>

  <img src="snow_photo.jpg" alt="photo of snow falling on the Brule River" width="700">

  <h2>First snow on the Brule River</h2>
    <p>This snow took fell unexpectedly the second week of October.</p>
    <p>The river is located in Brule Wisconsin, right next to Lake Superior.</p>

  <img src="frog.jpg" alt="close up of a frog" width="700">

  <h2>Frog close-up</h2>
    <p>I was able to get an extreme close-up on this frog.</p>
    <p>The frog was sitting on our dock up north at my grandparents cabin.</p>
    <p>A very shallow depth of field is created.</p>
